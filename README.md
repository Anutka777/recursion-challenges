# Recursion challenges

## Sum of array
Write a method **#sum** which takes a random array of numbers and returns the 
sum of all elements. Use recursion for the solution.
## Count elements
Write a method **#count** which takes an array and returns the number of 
its elements.
## Max of array
Write a method **#max** which takes a random array of numbers and returns the 
largest element.
## Binary search
Write a method **#bin_search**, which takes an array of random numbers and a single integer. It should return either index of that integer in the array or nil.
## Quick sort
Write a method **#quick_sort** which takes a random array of numbers and returns this array sorted from the least number to the greatest.
