# Recursion challenges

## Sum of array
Write a method **#sum** which takes a random array of numbers and returns the 
sum of all elements. Use recursion for the solution.
## Count elements
Write a method **#count** which takes an array and returns the number of 
its elements.
## Max of array
Write a method **#max** which takes a random array of numbers and returns the 
largest element.
## Binary search
Write a method **#bin_search**, which takes an array of random numbers and a single integer. It should return either index of that integer in the array or nil.
## Quick sort
Write a method **#quick_sort** which takes a random array of numbers and returns this array sorted from the least number to the greatest.

## Sum of multiples of 3 and 5 (Project Euler)
Write a method **sum_of_mult** which takes an array of random integers and returns the sum of all elements that are multiples of 3 or 5.

## Sum of even fibonacci numbers (Project Euler)
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Largest prime factor (Project Euler)
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
